### Predicting Customer Churn - Market Analysis
This project involves predicting customer churn for a company in a particular industry. We will use market analysis data, as well as customer data, to build a predictive model for customer churn. The project will use both XGBoost and logistic regression algorithms to build the model.


### Project Overview
The main goal of this project is to build a predictive model for customer churn. We will use market analysis data, as well as customer data, to build the model. We will then evaluate the model's performance and compare the performance of the XGBoost and logistic regression algorithms.

### Dataset
The dataset we will use is a combination of market analysis data and customer data. The market analysis data includes information such as market share, industry growth rate, and customer demographics. The customer data includes information such as customer tenure, product usage, and customer satisfaction.

### Data Cleaning
Before building the predictive model, we will need to clean and preprocess the data. This will involve handling missing values, handling outliers, and transforming variables as necessary.

### Feature Engineering
In addition to preprocessing the data, we will also perform feature engineering to create new features that may be useful for predicting customer churn. This may involve creating interaction terms, transforming variables, or using domain knowledge to engineer new features.

### Model Building
We will use both XGBoost and logistic regression algorithms to build the predictive model. We will tune the hyperparameters for each algorithm using cross-validation to optimize the performance of the model.

### Model Evaluation
We will evaluate the performance of the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. We will also use a confusion matrix to visualize the performance of the model.

### Conclusion
In conclusion, this project will involve predicting customer churn for a company in a particular industry using market analysis data and customer data. We will use both XGBoost and logistic regression algorithms to build the predictive model and compare their performance. We will also perform data cleaning, feature engineering, and model evaluation to optimize the performance of the model.
